# REC_app

Our project is to create the Appointment application for Recreational center at MIU. 
MIU’s current students can register to the system and login with registered username and password. 
Once user enter to the system, he/she can create a new activity for available time and date. 
Also, the user has a possibility invite his friend to play with as well as able to see activity history. 
In addition, the system has a learn part which contains video tutorial.
