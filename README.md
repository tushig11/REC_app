# REC_app

Our project is to create the Appointment application for Recreational center at MIU. 
MIUâ€™s current students can register to the system and login with registered username and password. 
Once user enter to the system, he/she can create a new activity for available time and date. 
Also, the user has a possibility invite his friend to play with as well as able to see activity history. 
In addition, the system has a learn part which contains video tutorial.
